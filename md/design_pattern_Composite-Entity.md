## Summary

### Essence
The Composite Entity design pattern is used to represent a group of objects as a single entity. It provides a way to treat a group of objects the same way as a single object.

### Real examples

- Representing complex data structures as a single entity.
- Managing a group of related objects as a whole.
- Providing a simplified interface to manipulate a group of objects.


```mermaid
classDiagram
  class CompositeEntity {
    +setData(data: string): void
    +getData(): string
  }
  class DependentObject1 {
    +setData(data: string): void
    +getData(): string
  }
  class DependentObject2 {
    +setData(data: string): void
    +getData(): string
  }
  class CoarseGrainedObject {
    +setData(data1: string, data2: string): void
    +getData(): string
  }
  CompositeEntity --> DependentObject1
  CompositeEntity --> DependentObject2
  CompositeEntity --> CoarseGrainedObject
  CoarseGrainedObject --> DependentObject1
  CoarseGrainedObject --> DependentObject2
```

## Implementation
### How to use it?
To use the Composite Entity design pattern, follow these steps:
1. Create the dependent objects that will be part of the composite entity.
2. Create the coarse-grained object that will manage the dependent objects.
3. Create the composite entity that will encapsulate the dependent objects and the coarse-grained object.
4. Use the composite entity to manipulate the dependent objects as a single entity.

### Python code examples:
```python

# Example implementation of the Composite Entity design pattern in Python

class DependentObject1:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = ''

    def set_data(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def get_data(self):
        return self.data


class DependentObject2:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = ''

    def set_data(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def get_data(self):
        return self.data


class CoarseGrainedObject:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dependent_object1 = DependentObject1()
        self.dependent_object2 = DependentObject2()

    def set_data(self, data1, data2):
        self.dependent_object1.set_data(data1)
        self.dependent_object2.set_data(data2)

    def get_data(self):
        return f'{self.dependent_object1.get_data()}, {self.dependent_object2.get_data()}'


class CompositeEntity:
    def __init__(self):
        self.coarse_grained_object = CoarseGrainedObject()

    def set_data(self, data1, data2):
        self.coarse_grained_object.set_data(data1, data2)

    def get_data(self):
        return self.coarse_grained_object.get_data()


# Usage
composite_entity = CompositeEntity()
composite_entity.set_data('Data 1', 'Data 2')
data = composite_entity.get_data()
print(data)  # Output: Data 1, Data 2

```

- The Python code example demonstrates the implementation of the Composite Entity design pattern. It defines dependent objects, a coarse-grained object, and a composite entity. The composite entity encapsulates the dependent objects and provides a simplified interface to manipulate them as a single entity.   


## Analysis
### Cleaner Code?

- Encapsulates the complexity of managing a group of objects into a single entity, reducing code duplication and improving code organization.
- Provides a clear separation of concerns by separating the dependent objects from the coarse-grained object, allowing for easier maintenance and modification of the code.

### Readable Code?

- Improves code readability by providing a high-level interface to manipulate a group of objects, making the code more intuitive and easier to understand.
- Promotes code reuse by encapsulating the common functionality of the dependent objects into the composite entity, reducing code duplication and improving code readability.

### Replaceable code?

- Promotes loose coupling by encapsulating the dependent objects and the coarse-grained object into separate entities, allowing for easier modification and replacement of the objects without affecting the other objects.
- Provides a clear separation of concerns, allowing for easier maintenance and modification of the code.

### Testable code?

- Makes the code easier to test by providing a single entry point to manipulate a group of objects, allowing for easier creation of test cases and reducing the complexity of testing.
- Promotes modular design by encapsulating the dependent objects and the coarse-grained object into separate entities, allowing for easier isolation of the code during testing.

### Advantages?

- Simplifies the manipulation of a group of related objects.
- Provides a high-level interface to interact with the group of objects.
- Promotes code reuse and reduces code duplication.
- Improves code organization and maintainability.
- Allows for easier modification and replacement of objects.
- Enhances code readability and understandability.
- Facilitates easier testing and debugging.
- Solves the problem of managing a group of related objects as a single entity.

### Disadvantages?

- May introduce additional complexity and overhead.
- Requires careful design and implementation to ensure proper encapsulation and separation of concerns.
- May not be suitable for all scenarios and may require customization for specific use cases.


## Remarks
### Concerns and Tips?

- The Composite Entity design pattern promotes loose coupling and separation of concerns.
- Care must be taken to ensure proper encapsulation and separation of concerns.
- The design and implementation should be flexible enough to accommodate changes and modifications to the group of objects.
- The performance and efficiency of the composite entity should be considered, especially when dealing with large groups of objects.
